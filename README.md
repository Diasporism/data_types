Ruby Data Types
=======

This is a tutorial focused repo with a number of exercises to help those with little to no programming experience learn the fundamentals of Ruby data types.

Running the App
=======

The first step to run the application is to clone this repo onto your local machine:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:Diasporism/data_types.git
```

CD into the application's directory and user Bundler to install it's dependencies:

```shell
$ bundle
```

Finally, run the specs:

```shell
rspec
```

You should see a bunch of failing specs (red 'F' symbols).

Your goal is to work through each section under the app/data_types directory, solving each problem and re-running the specs as you go.

If you solve a problem, you'll know you've done it correctly if there is one less spec failing when running the spec suite.

When all the specs turn into green dots, you've finished :)

Have fun!
